We must be skeptical yet open-minded. We must be bold yet conservative. A \"good\" scientist is one that balances these values. Learning this balance is a life-long process, but it is the most rewarding endeavor. Primary skills Population genetics: dN/dS, nucleotide diversity, selective sweep statistics, phylogenetic comparative methods Genomics: variant calling, bulk RNA-seq analysis, k-mer analyses Computational biology: snakemake workflows, high-performance and cloud computing, R, python, latex, github, bash Evolution of environment-specific gene expression K-mer-based approaches to population genetics, estimating genetic diversity Machine learning modles to estimate timing of allele frequency trajectories","title":"Research"},{"location":"research/#reserach-philosophy","text":"I believe that scientists are defined by their ability to balance competing values of the scientific enterprise.
