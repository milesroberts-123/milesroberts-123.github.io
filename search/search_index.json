I was elected Treasurer for two years and am currently serving as the President. Each month I chair both an executive board meeting, comprised of 8 elected members, and a membership meeting comprised of 70+ grad/professional student representatives from across campus. My role as President is to coordiate the actions of the 7 executive board members and to serve as the communication channel between graduate/professional student representatives and higher administration (Board of Trustees, President, Deans, Provosts, etc.). In this role, I advocate for issues pertaining to the academic, financial, and social well-being of graduate and professional students in my regular interactions with admin.","title":"DEI"},{"location":"dei/#council-of-graduate-students","text":"Period: 2022-2025 During graduate school, I worked closely with the Council of Graduate Students , the official graduate student government at MSU representing all ~11,000 graduate and professional students.

In this paper, I investigated whether the environment-specificity of a gene's expression affects the strength of purifying selection acting on it. The key idea behind this expectation is that selection acts on phenotypes. Thus, selection can only act to conserve a given DNA element when that element is producing a phenotype. If only some individuals in a population are experiencing heat stress, for example, then only that subset of individuals will experience selection to maintain their heat stress responses. The other individuals not experiencing heat stress could accumulate substitutions in their heat tolerance genes without any consequence. This expectation is well-solidified in theoretical papers, but has not been tested experimentally. I leveraged about 20 terabases of RNA-seq data in Arabidopsis thaliana from over 200 different environmental conditions to test this hypothesis. K-mer-based approaches to population genetics Preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.17.594778 This is the second chapter of my dissertation and it is currently undergoing peer review.
