# Reserach Philosophy

I believe that scientists are defined by their ability to balance competing values of the scientific enterprise. We must be skeptical yet open-minded. We must be bold yet conservative. A "good" scientist is one that balances these values. Learning this balance is a life-long process, but it is the most rewarding endeavor.

# Primary skills 

* Population genetics: dN/dS, nucleotide diversity, selective sweep statistics, phylogenetic comparative methods

* Genomics: variant calling, bulk RNA-seq analysis, k-mer analyses

* Computational biology: snakemake workflows, high-performance and cloud computing, R, python, latex, github, bash

# Evolution of environment-specific gene expression

# K-mer-based approaches to population genetics, estimating genetic diversity

# Machine learning modles to estimate timing of allele frequency trajectories
