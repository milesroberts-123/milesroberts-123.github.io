GEN 840

In Spring 2024, I TA-ed a writing course for graduate students in the Genetics and Genome Sciences program. Students would turn in a draft of a research proposal section each week. In class, I would then lead discussions about each student's writing, providing points of improvement in their structure, clarity, flow, and diction. Students also took this opportunity to review each other's writing and practice providing feedback to each other.

We used [Writing Science by Joshua Schimel](https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/kupinski/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2023/01/Writing_Science_Joshua_Schimel.pdf) as the class textbook.

# Plant genomics

PLB 812

Coming Fall 2024, I will help teach a few sections a plant genomics course taught by Emily Josephs and Bob Vanburen.
