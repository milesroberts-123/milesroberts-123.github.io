I co-led a writing course for graduate students in the Genetics and Genome Sciences program. Students would turn in a draft of a research proposal section each week. In class, I would lead discussions about each student's writing, providing points of improvement in their structure, clarity, flow, and diction. Students also took this opportunity to review each other's writing and practice providing feedback to each other.

We used [Writing Science by Joshua Schimel](https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/kupinski/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2023/01/Writing_Science_Joshua_Schimel.pdf) as the class textbook.
