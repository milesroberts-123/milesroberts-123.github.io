# Council of Graduate Students

Period: 2022-2025

During graduate school, I worked closely with the [Council of Graduate Students](https://cogs.msu.edu/), the official graduate student government at MSU representing all ~11,000 graduate and professional students. I was elected Treasurer for two years and am currently serving as the President. Each month I chair both an executive board meeting, comprised of 8 elected members, and a membership meeting comprised of 70+ grad/professional student representatives from across campus. My role as President is to coordiate the actions of the 7 executive board members and to serve as the communication channel between graduate/professional student representatives and higher administration (Board of Trustees, President, Deans, Provosts, etc.).

In this role, I advocate for issues pertaining to the academic, financial, and social well-being of graduate and professional students in my regular interactions with admin.
